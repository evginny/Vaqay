## Project Description:
The project aims to simplify the process of budgeting and expense management for travelers, particularly those traveling in large groups. It is a collaborative web application that provides a user-friendly platform for creating, managing, and analyzing travel budgets. The application facilitates the division of costs among group members and enables real-time tracking of transactions to ensure adherence to the budget.

## Features:
### Budget Creation:
The web application provides users with the flexibility to create both personal and shared budgets for their trips. Users have the option to create a personal budget, where they can set their own spending goals and allocate funds to various expense categories such as transportation, food, and activities based on their individual preferences.
Additionally, our application supports the creation of shared budgets, allowing users to collaborate with others in their travel group. Users can invite fellow travelers to join a shared budget, enabling seamless coordination and division of expenses among the group members. This feature promotes transparency and simplifies the process of managing shared costs, ensuring everyone is on the same page when it comes to budgeting for the trip.
### Transaction Tracking:
The application enables users to log their transactions in real time. Whether it's expenses related to accommodation (e.g., Airbnb), transportation (e.g., gas, flights), or other expenditures, users can easily record and track their transactions. This feature provides users with a clear overview of their spending and helps them make informed decisions to stay within their budget.
### User Management:
The application allows users to manage their personal information and change their passwords as needed. This feature ensures that users have control over their account details and can maintain the security of their information.
## Dependencies:
The project relies on the following dependencies:
Python: The project is developed primarily using Python programming language. Therefore, Python needs to be installed on the system for proper functioning.
Jinja: We utilize Jinja as a templating engine for rendering HTML or other markup languages in our Python-based web application. Installing the Jinja library as a Python module is necessary for our project.
Flask: We employ Flask, a lightweight web framework, for the development of our web application in Python. Installation of Flask as a Python module is required to run our project.
MySQL: Our chosen relational database management system is MySQL, which is used for data storage and retrieval. To interact with the MySQL database, the project necessitates the installation of the MySQL connector as a Python module.
