## Project Description:
Our project aims to simplify the process of budgeting and expense management for travelers, particularly those traveling in large groups. We are developing a collaborative web application that provides a user-friendly platform for creating, managing, and analyzing travel budgets. The application will facilitate the division of costs among group members and enable real-time tracking of transactions to ensure adherence to the budget.
